# Simply Order Tutorials
This is a series of tutorials that walk through designing and implementing a distributed Order System for a hypothetical company called Simply Order.
The highlight of this work is not just coding, but exploring real-world microservice challenges such as:
- Distributed transactions
- Saga (Choreography vs Orchestration)
- Temporal as an orchestration platform
- The Outbox pattern
- Reliability, retries, and compensations
- GraphQl

Each lesson presents a problem and explore, here are lessons so far
